Hi! Did you know?
Internet is dying, overtaken by biased search engines and corporate articles written on bloated, ad-ridden sites. Every second, your personality is being analyzed, processed, influenced, and made into a product.
Nothing is sincere anymore. 
Or, that's what it seems like at first glance. 
Truth is, there's never been a better time for the web! Once you skim the scum off the top, what's left in the pot is more people than there have ever been, creating more cool little spaces than the olden web could ever possibly support. 
And I find that beautiful. 
If this is your first time here, check through the icons on the left, that's where all the good stuff is. And check back once in a while! I plan to update this a lot c:
