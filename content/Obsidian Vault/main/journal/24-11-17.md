> Even if LibreOffice has been working fine for my notes so far, I do think something a little better for file managing and nicer to use wouldn't hurt. Going back to notion will never be an option so I think Obsidian will be perfect. 

> I've also started to work on my website again, mainly because it's due next week but also because it should help me get motivated to take classes on top of the one I go to at uni. At least that's what I say, it's also just a lot of fun to code and work on a personal project like this one :P

> Hopefully I won't be writing this much every time I come here to talk, will have to figure out if I even keep a journal here or not. Anyway take care!
